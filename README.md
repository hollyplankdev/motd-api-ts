# Setup

## Installing

Before you can do anything, the project must have its dependencies installed. Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed, then run `pnpm install` at the project root to grab all deps.

To run locally, this project also requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to be installed so that the database can be self-hosted easily.

## Linting

You can lint the whole project by running `pnpm lint` in the root of the project.

## Testing

You can test the whole project by running `pnpm test` in the root of the project. You can lint individual packages by navigating to one (such as `apps/express-backend`) and running `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` in its directory.

## Run express-backend locally

- cd to `apps/express-backend`
- Start the local database with `npm run dev:up`
- Run the app with `npm run dev`
- The API will be hosted on port 30330

## Run react-frontend locally

- Make sure that the backend is already running locally
- cd to `apps/react-frontend`
- Run the app with `npm run dev`
- The frontend will be hosted on a random port. See log output for detail.

## Run whole app with Docker

- cd to the root of the repo
- Run the whole app with `docker compose up --build`
